# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In python tuples are written with round brackets.
tupleCollection = ("pear", "banana", "orange")
print(tupleCollection)

# Access tuple items
print(tupleCollection[2])

# Changing tuple values is impossible. Tuples are unchangeable.
# You can loop throught a tuple, check if item exists in tuple, check its length
# You can not add new items or remove items from tuple
